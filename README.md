# LesHouches-Pythia-Delphes-link
Code used to link any LesHouches file (Events at parton level) to Pythia controlling all pythia options like ISR,FSR,Hadronization, decays of heavy hadrons and tau lepton decays with helicity conservation of tau lepton decays. The Pythia output is then passed to Delphes to produce detector level events with format .root and .lhco
